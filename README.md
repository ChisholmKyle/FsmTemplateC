# FsmTemplateC
Simple template for C Finite State Machine

## About This Module ##
This python module was originally created for my own personal use. I decided to 
respond to an old 
[StackExchange question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1647631/c-state-machine-design/31665273#31665273)
and threw the files up on GitHub (here). It's not well documented or tested, 
but it might be helpful to get you started on making a Finite State machine 
for C code.

## Try it out ##
To run the example, on the command line type 

    cd example
    python fsm_example.py

and have a look at the output source and header files generated in the 
subdirectory fsm_example.
